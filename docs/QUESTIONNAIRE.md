# Node Website Customization Questionnaire

This questionnaire will help us set up and customize your ReFi local node website. Please complete each section as thoroughly as possible. Don't worry if you're unsure about some technical details — we'll work through them together.

> **Tip**: Look at existing node websites for inspiration:
> - [ReFi Barcelona](https://refibcn.cat)
> - [ReFi DAO](https://refidao.com)
> - [Regenerant Catalunya](https://regenerant.refibcn.cat)

### How to Use This Questionnaire

**You don't need to complete everything at once!** This questionnaire supports gradual development:

1. **Start with the essentials** (Sections 1-2): Basic info and branding get you a working site
2. **Add content over time** (Sections 3-7): Fill in navigation, pages, and assets as you go
3. **Refine and expand**: Come back to add features, pages, or polish content

Each section can be completed independently, allowing you to launch with a minimal site and grow it organically. We'll customize what you've provided and can always add more later.
