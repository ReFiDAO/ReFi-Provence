# Node Website Customization Questionnaire

This questionnaire will help us set up and customize your ReFi local node website. Please complete each section as thoroughly as possible. Don't worry if you're unsure about some technical details — we'll work through them together.

> **Tip**: Look at existing node websites for inspiration:
> - [ReFi Barcelona](https://refibcn.cat)
> - [ReFi DAO](https://refidao.com)
> - [Regenerant Catalunya](https://regenerant.refibcn.cat)

### Getting Started

#### The Process

1. **Fork the repository** — Create your website repo from the template
2. **Add assets & materials** — Upload images, docs, and reference materials to your repo
3. **Answer this questionnaire** — Guide how the website should look and be structured
4. *(Optional)* **Quick call** — Walk through questions together
5. **Website customization** — We'll build based on your inputs
6. **Publish website** 🎉

#### Key Folders in Your Repository

| Folder | Purpose | File Types |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `assets/` | Visual assets (logos, images, photos) | PNG, JPG, SVG |
| `content/` | Actual content published on the website | Markdown (.md) |
| `docs/` | Internal documentation & reference materials | Any format |

> **Start by adding files to these folders** — the more materials you provide (docs, info, images), the better we can customize your website.

### How to Use This Questionnaire

**You don't need to complete everything at once!** This questionnaire supports gradual development:

1. **Start with the essentials** (Sections 1-3): Basic info, assets, and branding get you a working site
2. **Add content over time** (Sections 4-6): Fill in navigation, pages, and content drafts as you go
3. **Refine and expand**: Come back to add more content or polish

Each section can be completed independently, allowing you to launch with a minimal site and grow it organically.
